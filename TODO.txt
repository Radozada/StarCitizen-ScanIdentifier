IMPORTANT, URGENT
- Test the Tesseract integration on other PC's

IMPORTANT, NOT URGENT

- Toggle between Gems and Bigger Rocks for Ground Mining
- Somehow allow users to select what they're looking for, if what they searched for was what they were looking for, highlight the group area? Change its color?
  - Maybe a drop down of all elements in the selected mining method?   
- Clear history button

NOT IMPORTANT, NOT URGENT

- Make the results prettier
- Separate Gems from larger rocks in the Results section
- Add more color differentiation in the History Section. Time is gray. Mineral name is Purple. Search is Cyan. 

WISHLIST
- Fred is cleaning an eye icon on the ground, it'll be hilarious. (tome)
